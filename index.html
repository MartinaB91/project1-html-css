    <h1>Osis Pelargoniums</h1>
    <p id="top-bg-text">
      This all started when a mother gave her daughter three different clones of the pelargoniums she had. The daughter
      discovered that pelargoniums actually was really fun and wanted to have more of them. The mother agreed and they
      started to visit stores and looked online at stores and auctions to buy new sorts. For every new sort they bought
      they said that this one was the last one. Today we have more than 200 different sorts.

            know
            the father or nature had its own way. Either way it's time to put the seed in soil. There's a lot of
            different
            ways to hatch a seed, but that my friend is a whole different story.</p>

            start growing. The first leaf on the sprout is called heart leaf. That's because they always look the same,
            like small hearts. It's first when you reach the next step you will be able to see the shape of the real
            leafs (Just like a baby a sprout needs to be taken care of. It's really important it does not get dry). </p>

            are round or have sharp edges? Already here you can find out some things about your new plant. Pelargoniums
            come in many different sorts. Some processors that wants a special shape on the leaf, for example Zonartic
            can
            already in this step throw some clones away.</p>

          <p class="timeline-text">Waiting and waiting.... Now you need to wait for the plant to bloom. It can take from
            six months to several years depending on how flowerly your plant is. Maybe this sounds boring? Yeah, but
            when
            you can see the first bud rising it's all worth it! Unless the flower is not what you had expected or if it
            looks like any of the other thousands already existing sorts. Better luck next time!</p>

          <h4>Stable Plant <i class="far fa-smile"></i></h4>
          <p class="timeline-text">Flower power! The plant is blooming so now the process to get at stable plant must be
            done? Sorry, the answer is no. To be able to say you have a stable plant you need to have taken a clone on
            your young plant. That clone in turn needs to grow up and bloom so you can see that the flower still looks
            the
            same. This you need to do three times before you can call your plant stable.
            Your plant is now a great great grandmother!<br><br>
            As you can understand the way from seed to flower is long and it's only a few of all the seeds you put in
            the
            soil that reach this step. But if you made it this far you now have your very own Pelargonium. Now it's time
            for the easy part, give your flower a name and celebrate your new sort. Great job!</p>
