            You can say that it's a family trait when we do something do it wholeheartedly. So of course, just buying
            flowers from others wasn't enough, we had to have our own. The other family trait is bad luck, so we chose
            the name ”Osis” as our name which means bad luck in Swedish.

            Our goal as processors is to have pelargoniums that are strong growers, easy to maintain and have beautiful
            flowers. The categories of pelargoniums is of less importance for us as processors, we use everything from
            Zonarctic to Zonals in our processing.

                     reminded us of the character Barbapapa we liked a lot as children.

                     The color of this flower changes over time, the bud is really light but when time passes the
                     color gets stronger and stronger. This one grows straight up so it’s important that you prune it
                     to get a nice shape of the plant. When she first bloomed, we were struck by how grand and
                     majestic she was. This made us think of The Phoenix Fawkes in Harry Potter.

                     place it in full sun or in wandering shadow it doesn't matter. This flower really likes to

                     Rosa Pricken is our very first own pelargonium. We were so happy when we saw the bud! We were
                     less happy when the flower bud sprouted, it was ugly! But we really liked how this flower grows
                     so chose to save it, maybe in the future this plant can be the mother of a flower that we
                     actually like. ”Rosa Pricken” means pink dot in Swedish and as you can see the flower has a pink
                     dot on every flower leaf.
